# AI Maze Solver
This program solves a user-created maze in O(nlogn) time, including collisions with
other characters in the program.

Using a premade skeleton, I created a breadth-first and depth-first search model, as well
as two data structures from the ground up to develop the AI algorithm in C++. These are
tested against the included unit tests.

# Building
Run the .sln to build the project. This project is compatible with Visual Studio 2019 and newer.

Run main.cpp to initialize the project. Currently, a predefined main execution is setup, but you can
alter this to run unit tests.
